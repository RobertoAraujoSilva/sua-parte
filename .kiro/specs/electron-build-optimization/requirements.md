# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical Electron build failures on Windows systems, specifically the "file being used by another process" error when accessing app.asar during the packaging process. The solution will implement robust build process improvements, file handle management, and cross-platform compatibility enhancements to ensure reliable Electron application packaging.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Electron build process to complete successfully without file access errors, so that I can package and distribute the desktop application reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the electron:pack command is executed THEN the system SHALL complete the build process without "file being used by another process" errors
2. WHEN multiple build attempts are made in succession THEN the system SHALL properly clean up file handles between builds
3. WHEN the build process encounters locked files THEN the system SHALL implement retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
4. IF a previous build process is still running THEN the system SHALL detect and terminate orphaned processes before starting a new build

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want improved build performance and reliability across different Windows environments, so that the build process works consistently regardless of system configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building on Windows 10 or 11 THEN the system SHALL complete successfully with optimized file operations
2. WHEN antivirus software is running THEN the system SHALL handle temporary file access delays gracefully
3. WHEN building with limited system resources THEN the system SHALL optimize memory usage and file handle management
4. IF the build directory contains previous artifacts THEN the system SHALL safely clean and recreate the output directory

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive build logging and error reporting, so that I can quickly diagnose and resolve any build issues that occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a build error occurs THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error messages with specific file paths and process information
2. WHEN file access issues are detected THEN the system SHALL log which processes are using the files
3. WHEN the build completes THEN the system SHALL generate a build report with timing and resource usage statistics
4. IF build warnings occur THEN the system SHALL categorize them by severity and provide actionable recommendations

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated build environment validation, so that potential issues are identified before the build process begins.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN starting a build THEN the system SHALL verify that no conflicting processes are running
2. WHEN checking the build environment THEN the system SHALL validate sufficient disk space and permissions
3. WHEN detecting system constraints THEN the system SHALL recommend optimal build settings
4. IF environment issues are found THEN the system SHALL provide specific remediation steps

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want cross-platform build script compatibility, so that the same build process works on Windows, macOS, and Linux development environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN executing build scripts on any supported platform THEN the system SHALL use platform-appropriate commands and file operations
2. WHEN handling file paths THEN the system SHALL normalize paths for the target platform
3. WHEN managing processes THEN the system SHALL use platform-specific process management utilities
4. IF platform-specific optimizations are available THEN the system SHALL apply them automatically
